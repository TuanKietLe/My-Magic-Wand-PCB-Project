# My Magic Wand PCB Project

## Project Objective
As an electrial engineering student, being able to understand how **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** works is very important. Therefore, I have decided to make an intro project for my first PCB design ever. The expected outcomes from this project are:
* understanding the process of making a PCB, including: designing schematic, finding an appropriate footprint for each component, modifying route appropriately, and exporting Gerber and Drill files.
* getting used to digital IC chips, especially the 555 Timer.
