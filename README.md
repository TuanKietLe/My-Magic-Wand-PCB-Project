# My Magic Wand PCB Project

## Project Objective
As an electrial engineering student, being able to understand how **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** works is very important. Therefore, I have decided to make an intro project for my first PCB design ever. The expected outcomes from this project are:
* understanding the process of making a PCB, including: designing schematic, finding an appropriate footprint for each component, modifying route appropriately, and exporting Gerber and Drill files.
* being able to solder components on the PCB.
* getting used to digital IC chips, especially the 555 Timer.
## Introduction
For this project, I am designing a custom PCB for a "magic wand" that brings a touch of enchantment through a sequence of blinking LEDs. The goal of the project is to create a compact, handheld wand that lights up in a programmed pattern, simulating a magical effect. Using simple IC digital chips and a series of LEDs, this project will cover essential PCB design principles, including component layout, circuit routing, and power management. The wand will create dazzling light sequences, offering an interactive and visually engaging experience. This project not only combines electronics with creativity but also offers hands-on experience in designing a functional and aesthetic PCB.
